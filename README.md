# ridkit-master

## Introduction

ridkit is a python package for enhanced sampling via RiD(Reinforced Dynamics) method.

## Installation

#### install dependence
ridkit will need a specific software environment. We pack a easy-installed shell file located in env install.
~~~
cd env
sh rid.sh
~~~
Now you have all dependence of RiD (Gromacs, Tensorflow and a conda environment).
~~~
cd ritkit-master
python setup.py install
~~~
Open python, try `import ridkit`.

Install successfully if you get no error.

## Quick Start
We offer a simple but complete example in `ridkit/examples`

Try:
```
cd examples
python test.py
```

To begin with, you should offer a rid configeration file(rid.json), a CV file(phipsi_selected.json) and a dictory(mol/) containing initial conformation files in detail, and the number of conformation files should be equal to the number of walkers for parallel.

All these files are presented in `examples` dictory where the users can adjust the parameter as their will.



## Main procedure of RiD

RiD will run in iterations. Every iteration contains tasks below:

1. Biased MD;
2. Restrained MD;
3. Training neuro network.

#TODO

#### a. Biased MD

Just like Metadynamics, RiD will sample based on a bias potential given by NN models. A uncertainty indicator will direct the process of adding bias potential.

#### b. Restrained MD

This procedure will calculate mean force based on the sampling results, which can generate data set for training. 

#### c. Neuro network training

A fully connected NN will be trained via sampling data. This network will generate a map from selected CV to free energy.

A more detail description of RiD is published now, please see:

 # RiD settings



Two necessary json files are required to get start a RiD procedure.

1. rid.json for configuration of simulation.
2. cv.json for specifying CV.
